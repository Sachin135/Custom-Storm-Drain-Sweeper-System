Product Concept- Automated Diverter

Product Description-  Employs programming so that the stakeholders/users can divert water and clear certain routes. The diverter itself would be composed of the same plastic found in PVC pipes, 
polyvinyl chloride. PVC is known to withstand cold temperatures, though it does break down at 140 degrees F (however the water that will be on the roads will not be reaching that temperature so that 
is not a concern). The sensor would contain some strong metal like steel, and the pipe would not require many different materials. PVC is also relatively cheaper than other materials since it is 
produced on a mass scale, which fulfills our design requirement about both safety and cost.

Operation- This would involve automated movement, so specific openings of the diverter remain closed while liquid flows into the next diverter in the family. Water enters and is strained before falling 
out, and can either go through the first opening or fall into the next diverter or collection barrel/body of water. The sensor would be programmed with an closed-loop control system 
(also known as a feedback system) as it acts on the  basis of input AND output.

Justification- Though this idea is external to the drains themselves, they would prevent flooding by redirecting water carrying debris, preventing the debris from reaching and getting stuck or 
collecting in the drains. This would  fulfill many of our major design requirements (about 8/9) because the material is cheap but strong, so the product will last long and solve our problem. 
One potential drawback is requirement #5, which says the solution must be occurring within seconds. However, many of the benefits outweigh this, especially since it is lightweight and easy to install.
