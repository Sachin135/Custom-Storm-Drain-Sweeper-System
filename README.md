# Custom-Storm-Drain-Sweeper-System
An Arduino project that is designed to clear storm drain blockages and prevent street flooding from occurring.


Streets are turned into flooded rivers. Cars and pedestrians are unable to cross streets. Emergency response times are impeded. The culprit? Clogged storm drains.


Storm drains in my community are often blocked by twigs, snow, pebbles, grass clippings, trash, and, most prominently, leaves. This problem is especially
prevalent during the fall months, as trees shed their leaves, blocking the openings of the storm drains. There is a lack of preventative measures to address storm
drain blockages and the reduction of drainage efficiency that these blockages cause.
 
One way that I have invested my time that has strengthened my local community was when I built a custom storm drain sweeper system to clear drain blockages 
in my community. I Utilized CAD Onshape 3-d modeling to create a part studio and a preliminary digital prototype assembly to plan out my solution. I then used
circuit components, an Arduino Uno Rev3 microcontroller board, and the Arduino based C++ software program to control the dual-brush system I had created. After
testing out my prototype through 5 unique tests, I can conclude that my solution works and has the potential to help not only my local community but also those on a
larger scale.
